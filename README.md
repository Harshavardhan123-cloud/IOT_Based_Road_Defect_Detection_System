## Overview

This project utilizes a Raspberry Pi 4 equipped with a camera, depth sensors, and a GPS module to capture real-time road data. The collected data is processed by state-of-the-art object detection models (YOLOv11/YOLOv12) to identify various defects like potholes and rutting. By fusing visual data with sensor inputs, the system not only detects defects but also classifies their severity and logs their precise GPS coordinates into a MySQL database.

## Key Features

  - **Real-time Defect Detection:** Employs YOLOv11 and YOLOv12 models for fast and accurate identification of road anomalies from a live video feed.
  - **Sensor Fusion:** Integrates depth sensor data with visual features to improve detection accuracy and enable severity assessment.
  - **High-Accuracy Models:** Achieved a **72.38% mAP** through a combination of robust data annotation (via Roboflow) and sensor-enhanced model inputs.
  - **GPS Tagging:** Each detected defect is automatically tagged with its geographical coordinates for precise mapping and maintenance planning.
  - **Automated Severity Classification:** The system analyzes the size and depth of defects to classify them, helping prioritize repairs.
  - **Scalable Data Storage:** All collected data, including defect type, severity, location, and timestamp, is stored in a structured MySQL database.

## System Architecture

The workflow of the system is as follows:

1.  **Data Acquisition:** The Raspberry Pi-based IoT device, mounted on a vehicle, captures video, depth information, and GPS coordinates.
2.  **Data Preprocessing:** Sensor data is cleaned and synchronized with the corresponding video frames.
3.  **Defect Inference:** The processed frames are passed to the YOLO model, which draws bounding boxes around potential road defects.
4.  **Data Fusion & Classification:** The system correlates the bounding boxes with depth sensor data to estimate the defect's severity.
5.  **Data Storage:** The final, structured data (defect type, image, location, severity) is transmitted and stored in the central MySQL database for analysis and visualization.

## Hardware & Software Stack

### Hardware

  - Raspberry Pi 4 Model B
  - 90Â° Wide-Angle Camera Module
  - Ultrasonic Depth Sensors (e.g., HC-SR04)
  - GPS Module (e.g., NEO-6M)

### Software & Frameworks

  - **Language:** Python
  - **Deep Learning:** YOLOv11, YOLOv12
  - **Computer Vision:** OpenCV
  - **Database:** MySQL
  - **Data Annotation:** Roboflow



## Dataset

The custom dataset for this project was built by collecting real-world road images and videos. The data was meticulously annotated using **Roboflow** to create bounding boxes for various defect classes, including potholes and rutting.

## Results & Performance

The integrated system, combining visual data with sensor inputs, achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP) of **72.38%** on our validation dataset. The fusion of sensor data proved critical in reducing false positives and improving the model's ability to discern true defects under varying light conditions.

## Future Work

  - **Web-Based Dashboard:** Develop a dashboard to visualize the detected defects on a map in real-time.
  - **Real-time Alerts:** Implement a system to send automated alerts to municipal authorities when severe defects are detected.
  - **Model Expansion:** Train the model to recognize a wider variety of road issues, such as cracks and faded lane markings.
  - **Edge Optimization:** Use frameworks like TensorFlow Lite or ONNX to optimize the model for better performance on the Raspberry Pi.
